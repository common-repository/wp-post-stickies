WP Post Stickies allows for "sticky note" style text sidebars in pages and posts.

== Description ==

Ever have an important thought that you really want to include with your post or page content but you end up leaving it out because it didn't seem to fit anywhere?  In print media, this is called a "sidebar" and it is normally "placed adjacent to an article, graphically separate but with contextual connection."

WP Post Stickies lets you produce editorial sidebars in posts and pages, using the ubiquitous format of the "sticky note".  You can go to Settings/WP Post Stickies and use the UI to create a shortcode and then copy and paste it into your post or page, or you can use the new button in the editor toolbar to paste in a template shortcode.

WP Post Stickies also comes with a widget which allows you to use the shortcodes in a widget that can be displayed in any of your theme's widget areas.

We made WP Post Stickies for ourselves, but we hope you enjoy it too!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Use the Settings->WP Post Stickies screen to generate a shortcode
1. Copy/paste the shortcode to a post or page


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why don't you have more/different colors? =

We went with standard "sticky note" pastels.  We are planning to add some other types of posts to the plugin which will offer additional color and style options.

= Why is there blank space at the bottom of my note? =

Sticky notes (the real ones) tend to be either square or rectangular, so we set up our plugin with a minimum height.  If you just use a few words of text, you'll have some white-space at the bottom.  If you use a ton of words, however, the note will scale.

== Changelog ==

= 1.6.0 =
* Notes are now a custom post type, thus adding all of the features inherent to CPTs.  (The old shortcodes still work, so upgrading shouldn't break existing notes.)

= 1.1.1 =
* Fixed issue where "optional" was sometimes showing up on the widget link.

= 1.1.0 =
* Widget now supports an optional URL for linking to other content.

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release.
